    <h3 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">type of cards for carding</h3>
    <p>each credit card company starts there card with the diffrent number: <br><br> </p>

    each card company has their spesific type of card here are some of the basic </p>

    <h3>visa</h3>
    <p>classic-a universal payment tool , which was adopted world wide in any <br><br>
        locations designated by the logo of Visa, including ATMs, real and virtual stores, and shops offering
        goods and services by mail and telephone. This card is intended for those who already have
        experience in the use of bank cards. It also enjoys popularity among consumers of middle-income, as
        guaranteed convenience, choice and financial flexibility. Gold – One of the leading products, has
        been adopted worldwide and allows you to enjoy an impressive financial freedom (higher limit) I
        Platinum – These usually have limits over $10,000 (but note, just because it has a high limit, doesn’t
        mean it isn’t already maxed out) Signature – No preset spending limit – great bin to get Infinite –
        Most prestigious card, virtually no limit. Though there are less in circulation so be cautious when
        buying these, stick with reputable sellers. Business – it is used for small to medium sized businesses,
        usually has a limit. Corporate – it is used for medium to large size businesses, larger limit than
        business. Black – this got limited membership, $500 annual fee, high end card, it has no limit 
          </p>
          <h3>mastercard</h3>
          <p>
            Standard – similar to classic visa card. Gold – it is just like visa gold card Platinum – it is just like visa
            plat card World – has a very high limit World Elite – virtually no limit, it is an high end card. Amex <br><br>  Gold – usually around 10,000 limit Platinum– usually higher limit, and it is around 35000 Centurion –
            High limit, 75k+ (also known as the black card, but do not confuse with visa’s black card)

        <h3 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">what is been(bank identifiy number)</h3>
        <p>The first 6 numbers of CC is the BIN number, So from the above example the bin is 486236</p>

        <p>So now we will collect some info about this BIN. For that there is so many websites.. e.g</p>
        <p><a href="www.exactbins.com" target="blank">www.exactbins</a></p>
        <p><a href="www.bins.pro">www.bins.pro</a></p>
        <p>Now we can calculate few things from above info.. approx balance, is this bin non vbv or vbv , Bank
            phone no. from google… etc. etc.I will explain later how to check cc balance with Skype method…
            </p>

</div>

<div class="suraj5">
    <h3 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">what is VBV/NON VBV/MSC</h3>
    <p>Now we can calculate few things from above info.. approx balance, is this bin non vbv or vbv , Bank
        phone no. from google… etc. etc.I will explain later how to check cc balance with Skype method…
        </p> <br><br>

        <p>NON VBV (Verified by Visa) Very easy to use. No need of more info about Credit Card like DOB, SSN,
            MMN. Also no need for OTP doing transaction.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>MSC (Mastercard Secure Code) Similar to VBV, but carders always buy NON VBV CC for carding.
                Cause the shopping site is VBV or NON VBV we don’t care, we have NON VBV CC.
                </p> <br><br>
                <p>So no OTP, no AVS, no need SSN etc. NON VBV is not verifired by visa card, you can buy anything
                with non vbv cards without going through 3rd verification process.
                </p> <br><br>

                <p>AVS – (Address Verification System) A system used to verify the identity of the person claiming to
                    own the credit card. The system will check the billing address of the credit card provided by the user
                    with the address on file at the credit card company. This was an attempt to help identity theft and
                    fraud over the internet.</p> <br><br>
                    <p>This is a system we as carders dont have to worry about since we have the billing address of the
                        credit card holder.</p> <br><br>
                        <p>I mentioned it since it is good to be aware of it and that almost every site has this system. It
                            emplifies the importance of typing in the address correctly.
                            </p> <br><br>

    <h3>type of carding</h3>
    <p>According to some great carders, there are three types/levels of carding. They are listed as</p> <br><br>
    <br>

    <h3>easy carding</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In this level a carder do carding of very cheap goods. For example: small phone call bills, etc. Mostly
        in this level the carder use to do carding of goods below 50$. This is known as the beginners level of
        carding</p> <br><br>
        <h3>intermediat carding</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In this level the carder do carding of slightly higher goods like background reports, or very small
            physical items like some clothes. Mostly in this level carders use to do carding of goods below 50$.
            The different between the Level 1 and Level 2 carding is that Level 2 do carding of physical items.</p> <br><br>
            <h3>hard carding</h3> <br><br>
            <p>This is regarded as the advance carding. In this level the carder do carding of everything this
                includes: cellphones , laptops and other goods. Mostly in this level the carder use to do carding of
                goods above 50$ and the upper limits is not fixed.</p> <br><br>
                <p>We suggest that if you want to start your life as carder mover from level 1 to 3 gradually. Don’t try to
                    go on Hard Carding if you have no idea of carding because it may end up you at jail.
                    </p> <br><br>
                    <p>Now that you know all the needful about carding, let’s move to the main part….</p><br>
                    <p>To progress with this stage make sure you have gathered all your tools:</p><br>
                    <p>Credit Card, Socks5 matching with the CC owner address, CCleaner Software, MAC address changer
                        software, High Speed internet</p>
                        <br><br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to use socks in Mozilla Firefox</li>
                            <li>Open your firefox
                            </li>
                            <li>Go to Options</li>
                            <li>Click on Advanced setting</li>
                            <li>Select Network and setup port and proxy</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Now the screen will pop up with various options like : 1. No proxy; 2.Auto Detect; 3.Use system
                        proxy; 4. Manual proxy configuration. You mark 4. Manual proxy configuration. Now type in socks
                        host IP you have</p> <br><br>
                        <p>For example Socks Host: 161.0.8.34 Port: 1080</p>

    <h3>latest mathod of carding</h3>
    <p>This carding method is easy and simple to do on any online shopping site, you just have to buy a
        valid cc and viola! you can start carding but make sure there is balance in cc otherwise order will be
        failed</p> <br><br>
        <p>Create an email account with CC matching name. E.g If CC name is Martins John then make like
            Martinsjohn32@gmail.com Now Run Remote Desktop Connection and connect with your RDP Host.
            But if are not using rdp then follow the below steps… Run MAC address changer, change all MAC
            address. Run CCleaner. Analyze and clean. Set socks5 in Mozzila firefox. I believe I explained that
            already, scroll up if you didn’t read it. Now Restart Firefox and goto www.check2ip.com and check if
            your ip is blacklisted or not and is it the same as CC holder address. Now open any shopping site. I
            will recommend a shopping site from your country. Why? Because you dont need to wait a lot to get
            your package Now Register with credit card holder information, name, country, city, address, and
            email you made one just for this order. Choose your item & add to cart. Never choose big amount
            items first. In shipping address enter your address or your drop address, where you want to deliver
            product. Go to payment page, choose Credit Card as payment method Enter your CC details. Like CC
            Number, CC holder name, CVV/CVV, Exp. Date. Don’t copy & paste info. Type it one by one. Cause
            most site have copy-paste detector script.. In Billing address enter CC holder address. Now proceed
            to payment. See Also: Ghost in the Wires: Adventures Of World's Most Wanted Hacker
            </p><br>
            <p>I am sure if you do everything right then order will be successfully placed</p>
            <br>
            <p>Wait for order to arrive to your shipping address. When they arrive the courier boy will call you.
                Then ask for any ID card. If you can make fake ID card then good. Otherwise show your any ID card
                (School ID Voter ID, College ID card)</p><br><br>
                <p>NOTE: Try to card small amount item first within $200, then after shipping you can go for big order,
                    try to use fast delivery</p><br>
                    <p></p>

    <h3>how to card using a mobile phone</h3>

    <p>I will advice against carding using phone cause it’s kind of risky, but if you can follow the beloe
        procedures, then you can card using your device</p><br><br>

        <h3>Requirements For Carding From Mobile Phone :
        </h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>Your Mobile must be rooted. You must install the following apps : IMEI changer, Phone ID changer,
            Android ID changer, Proxy Droid, CCleaner Then, you can use WindScribe VPN for carding in mobile. </p><br><br>
            <p>Use SOCK5 proxy with Proxy Droid apps. You need to change IMEI, Android ID etc before you start
                carding. Now connect to your proxy droid with SOCKS5 proxy and connect it. Now follow all steps of
                carding that mentioned above…
                </p><br><br>
                <p>Ok, so you got your cc, your drop and try to be anonymous as you can make yourself</p><br><br>
                <h3>Security Tips</h3><br>
                <p>When ever you have a CC, the next step is to get a socks5 in either the same city and state as the
                    card holder, or as close to it as you can find. You must use socks. I recommend using firefox since it is
                    stable, easy to use, you can load many unique and helpful plugins (tamper data, sniffers, etc). Don’t
                    use Chrome ever. Many carders do neglect to clear history, or instead of shutting down their
                    computer just put it to sleep so they dont have to wait for it to decrypt, etc. What am trying to say is
                    DON’T BE A LAZY DUDE ! Emails – always create email for every site you card. Either Gmail or Yahoo
                    is good. How to Check Balance on Credit Card?<br><br>
                    There are many sites that claims to help check CC balance but many of them are fake and backdoors,
                    and many of them do make valid CC dead <br><br>
                    So Follow Steps Mention Below, the Steps will only work with US and UK Based CC’s. <br><br>
                    Check your BIN in www.binspro.com and get your bank name. For example of the BIN (430587), the
                    bank is Capital One, USA. Now search phone number bank in google. For this bank, it’s +1-800-935-
                    6757 Call the number on Skype, it’s free since it’s toll-free number. Now the automatic robot will ask
                    you some info. Ex. CCN, CVV etc. Now put your info by using your keyboard. It will automatically tell
                    you the CC balance.</p>
